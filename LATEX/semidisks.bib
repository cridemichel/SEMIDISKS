    abstract = "{ Two factors are mainly responsible for the stability of the DNA double helix: base pairing between complementary strands and stacking between adjacent bases. By studying DNA molecules with solitary nicks and gaps we measure temperature and salt dependence of the stacking free energy of the DNA double helix. For the first time, DNA stacking parameters are obtained directly (without extrapolation) for temperatures from below room temperature to close to melting temperature. We also obtain DNA stacking parameters for different salt concentrations ranging from 15 to 100 mM Na + . From stacking parameters of individual contacts, we calculate base-stacking contribution to the stability of A•T- and G•C-containing DNA polymers. We find that temperature and salt dependences of the stacking term fully determine the temperature and the salt dependence of DNA stability parameters. For all temperatures and salt concentrations employed in present study, base-stacking is the main stabilizing factor in the DNA double helix. A•T pairing is always destabilizing and G•C pairing contributes almost no stabilization. Base-stacking interaction dominates not only in the duplex overall stability but also significantly contributes into the dependence of the duplex stability on its sequence. }",

    abstract = { ▪ Abstract DNA secondary structure plays an important role in biology, genotyping diagnostics, a variety of molecular biology techniques, in vitro–selected DNA catalysts, nanotechnology, and DNA-based computing. Accurate prediction of DNA secondary structure and hybridization using dynamic programming algorithms requires a database of thermodynamic parameters for several motifs including Watson-Crick base pairs, internal mismatches, terminal mismatches, terminal dangling ends, hairpins, bulges, internal loops, and multibranched loops. To make the database useful for predictions under a variety of salt conditions, empirical equations for monovalent and magnesium dependence of thermodynamics have been developed. Bimolecular hybridization is often inhibited by competing unimolecular folding of a target or probe DNA. Powerful numerical methods have been developed to solve multistate-coupled equilibria in bimolecular and higher-order complexes. This review presents the current parameter set available for making accurate DNA structure predictions and also points to future directions for improvement. }

These materials are strongly different. Very long polymer chains occur in the organic matrix of skeletal tissues or in chromosomes. On the contrary, in a cholesteric liquid crystal, the molecules are free to move one along the other. However the geometry of such systems is similar. The objections to the twisted model are reviewed and evidence is presented to support a generalized twisted model. A list of the known biological cholesteric analogues is given.}

We rule out this smectic hypothesis and demonstrate by polarizing microscopy, electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction that this phase is characterized by a columnar longitudinal order and a hexagonal lateral order, with intermolecular distances ranging from 2.8 to 4.0 nm depending on the DNA concentration.},

abstract = {Abstract DNA restriction fragments ranging from 79 to 789 base pairs in length have been characterized by transient electric birefringence (TEB) measurements at various temperatures between 4 and 43°C. The DNA fragments do not contain runs of four or more adenine residues in a row and migrate with normal electrophoretic mobilities in polyacrylamide gels, indicating that they are not intrinsically curved or bent. The low ionic strength buffers used for the measurements contained 1 mM Tris Cl, pH 8.0, EDTA, and variable concentrations of Na+ or Mg2+ ions. The rotational relaxation times were obtained by fitting the TEB field-free decay signals with a nonlinear least-squared fitting program; the decay of the birefringence was monoexponential for fragments ≤ 241 base pair (bp) in length and multiexponential for larger fragments. The terminal relaxation times, characteristic of the end-over-end rotation of the DNA molecules, were then used todetermine the persistence length (p) and hydrodynamic radius (r) of DNA as a function of temperature and ionic strength, using several different hydrodynamic models. The specific values obtained for p and r are model dependent. The wormlike chain model of P. J. Hagerman and B. H. Zimm (Biopolymers 1981, Vol. 20, pp. 1481–1502) combined with the revised Broersma equation (J. Newman et al., Journal of Mol Biol 1997, Vol. 116, pp. 593–606) appears to be the most suitable for describing the flexibility of DNA in low ionic strength solutions. The values of p and r obtained from the global least squares fitting of this equation are independent of DNA length, and the deviations of the individual values from the average are reasonably small. The consensus r value calculated for DNA in various low ionic strength solutions containing 1 mM Tris buffer is 14.7 ± 0.4 Å at 20°C. The consensus p values decrease from 814 ∼ 564 Å in solutions containing 1 mM Tris buffer plus 0.2–1 mM NaCl and decrease still further to 440 Å in solutions containing 0.2 mM Mg2+ ions. The persistence length exhibits a shallow maximum at 20°C and decreases slowly upon either increasing or decreasing the temperature, regardless of the model used to fit the data. By contrast, the consensus values of the hydrodynamic radius are independent of temperature. The calculated persistence lengths and hydrodynamic radii are compared with other data in the literature. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Biopolymers 61: 261–275, 2002},

abstract = {Critical concentrations for the isotropic to cholesteric phase transitions of double-stranded DNA fragments in simple buffered saline (0.1 M NaCl) solutions were determined as a function of DNA contour length ranging from approximately 50 nm to 2700 nm, by solid-state 31P NMR spectroscopy and polarized light microscopy. As expected for semirigid chains, the critical concentrations decrease sharply with increasing DNA length near the persistence length in the range from 50 to 110 nm, and approach a plateau when the contour length exceeds 190 nm. The biphasic region is substantially wider than observed for xanthan, another semirigid polyelectrolyte approximately twice as stiff as DNA, primarily because of low critical concentrations for first appearance of the anisotropic phase, C(i)*, in DNA samples > or =110 nm (320 base pairs) long. The limiting C(i)* for DNA > or =490 nm long is exceptionally low (only 13 mg/ml) and is substantially lower than the C(i)* of approximately 40 mg/ml reported for the stiffer xanthan polyelectrolyte. The much higher values of the critical concentrations, C(a)*, for the disappearance of the isotropic DNA phase (> or =67 mg/ml) are modestly higher than those observed for xanthan and are predicted reasonably well by a theory that has been applied to other semirigid polymers, if a DNA persistence length in the consensus range of 50–100 nm is assumed. By contrast, the broad biphasic region and low C(i)* values of DNA fragments > or =190 nm long could only be reconciled with theory by assuming persistence lengths of 200–400 nm. The latter discrepancies are presumed to reflect some combination of deficiencies in current theory as applied to chiral, strong polyelectrolytes such as DNA, and sequence-dependent variations in DNA properties such as flexibility, curvature, or interaction potential. The propensity of DNA to spontaneously self-order at low concentrations well in the physiological range may have biological significance.}

Upon cooling mixed solutions of short DNA oligomers, in which only a small fraction of the DNA present is complementary, the duplex-forming oligomers phase-separate into liquid crystal droplets, leaving the unpaired single strands in isotropic solution. In a chemical environment where oligomer ligation is possible, such ordering and condensation would provide an autocatalytic link whereby complementarity promotes the extended polymerization of complementary oligomers.}}

abstract = {A recently developed mechanochemical method has provided a new, efficient tool for studies on the thermal stability and structure of aggregated DNA in ethanol-water solutions. At low ethanol concentrations DNA is fully soluble and is in the B form. However, with increasing ethanol concentration the melting temperature of DNA, Tm, decreases. At a critical ethanol concentration dependent on the nature and concentration of the counterion, aggregation of the DNA molecules sets in. This is reflected in a marked increase in Tm indicating that the aggregated DNA molecules are thermally more stable than the dissolved ones. However, they are still in the B form. In general, Tm of aggregated DNA also decreases with further increasing ethanol concentration and is dependent on the nature of the counterion, but Tm is not affected by the concentration of the counterion (excess salt) in the ethanol-water solution. When the ethanol concentration reaches the range of 70–80% (v/v), the B-to-A conformational transition occurs in the case of Na-, K- and CsDNA. Above this transition point the A form is more stable than the B form due to the reduced water activity and to increased interhelical interactions. At very high ethanol concentrations, above 85% and dependent on the nature of the counterion, a drastic change in the thermal behaviour is observed. Apparently such a strong interhelical interaction is induced in the aggregated DNA that the DNA is stabilized and cannot adopt a random coil state even at very high temperatures. This stability of DNA in the P form is fully reversed if the ethanol concentration is lowered and the activity of water, thereby, is restored.}

	Abstract = {Conditions of formation of DNA aggregates by the addition of spermidine were determined with 146 base pair DNA fragments as a function of spermidine and NaCl concentration. Two different phases of spermidine-DNA complexes are obtained: a cholesteric liquid crystalline phase with a large helical pitch, with interhelix distances ranging from 31.6 to 32.6 A, and a columnar hexagonal phase with a restricted fluidity in which DNA molecules are more closely packed (29.85 +/- 0.05 A). In both phases, the DNA molecule retains its B form. These phases are always observed in equilibrium with the dilute isotropic solution, and their phase diagram is defined for a DNA concentration of 1 mg/ml. DNA liquid crystalline phases induced by spermidine are compared with the DNA mesophases already described in concentrated solutions in the absence of spermidine. We propose that the liquid crystalline character of the spermidine DNA complexes is involved in the stimulation of the functional properties of the DNA reported in numerous experimental articles, and we discuss how the nature of the phase could regulate the degree of activity of the molecule.},

abstract = {Topoisomerases I promote the relaxation of DNA superhelical tension by introducing a transient single-stranded break in duplex DNA and are vital for the processes of replication, transcription, and recombination. The crystal structures at 2.1 and 2.5 angstrom resolution of reconstituted human topoisomerase I comprising the core and carboxyl-terminal domains in covalent and noncovalent complexes with 22–base pair DNA duplexes reveal an enzyme that “clamps” around essentially B-form DNA. The core domain and the first eight residues of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the enzyme, including the active-site nucleophile tyrosine-723, share significant structural similarity with the bacteriophage family of DNA integrases. A binding mode for the anticancer drug camptothecin is proposed on the basis of chemical and biochemical information combined with these three-dimensional structures of topoisomerase I–DNA complexes.}}

abstract = {Solvent binding in the nucleosome core particle containing a 147 base pair, defined-sequence DNA is characterized from the X-ray crystal structure at 1.9Å resolution. A single-base-pair increase in DNA length over that used previously results in substantially improved clarity of the electron density and accuracy for the histone protein and DNA atomic coordinates. The reduced disorder has allowed for the first time extensive modeling of water molecules and ions. Over 3000 water molecules and 18 ions have been identified. Water molecules acting as hydrogen-bond bridges between protein and DNA are approximately equal in number to the direct hydrogen bonds between these components. Bridging water molecules have a dual role in promoting histone–DNA association not only by providing further stability to direct protein–DNA interactions, but also by enabling formation of many additional interactions between more distantly related elements. Water molecules residing in the minor groove play an important role in facilitating insertion of arginine side-chains. Water structure at the interface of the histones and DNA provides a means of accommodating intrinsic DNA conformational variation, thus limiting the sequence dependency of nucleosome positioning while enhancing mobility. Monovalent anions are bound near the N termini of histone α-helices that are not occluded by DNA phosphate groups. Their location in proximity to the DNA phosphodiester backbone suggests that they damp the electrostatic interaction between the histone proteins and the DNA. Divalent cations are bound at specific sites in the nucleosome core particle and contribute to histone–histone and histone–DNA interparticle interactions. These interactions may be relevant to nucleosome association in arrays.}

abstract = {We present the crystalline organization of 33 all-AT deoxyoligonucleotide duplexes, studied by x-ray diffraction. Most of them have very similar structures, with Watson-Crick basepairs and a standard average twist close to 36°. The molecules are organized as parallel columns of stacked duplexes in a helical arrangement. Such organization of duplexes is very regular and repetitive: all sequences show the same pattern. It is mainly determined by the stacking of the terminal basepairs, so that the twist in the virtual TA base step between neighbor duplexes is always negative, ∼−22°. The distance between the axes of parallel columns is practically identical in all cases, ∼26Å. Interestingly, it coincides with that found in DNA viruses and fibers in their hexagonal phase. It appears to be a characteristic distance for ordered parallel DNA molecules. This feature is due to the absence of short range intermolecular forces, which are usually due to the presence of CG basepairs at the end of the oligonucleotide sequence. The duplexes apparently interact only through their diffuse ionic atmospheres. The results obtained can thus be considered as intermediate between liquid crystals, fibers, and standard crystal structures. They provide new information on medium range DNA-DNA interactions.}

While modern NAs have been optimized by evolution to accomplish various biological functions, such as catalysis or transmission of genetic information, primitive NAs could have emerged and been selected based on more rudimental chemical–physical properties, such as their propensity to self-assemble into supramolecular structures. One such supramolecular structure available to primitive NAs are liquid crystal (LC) phases, which are the outcome of the collective behavior of short DNA or RNA oligomers or monomers that self-assemble into linear aggregates by combinations of pairing and stacking. Formation of NA LCs could have provided many essential advantages for a primitive evolving system, including the selection of potential genetic polymers based on structure, protection by compartmentalization, elongation, and recombination by enhanced abiotic ligation. Here, we review recent studies on NA LC assembly, structure, and functions with potential prebiotic relevance. Finally, we discuss environmental or geological conditions on early Earth that could have promoted (or inhibited) primitive NA LC formation and highlight future investigation axes essential to further understanding of how LCs could have contributed to the emergence of life.}",
