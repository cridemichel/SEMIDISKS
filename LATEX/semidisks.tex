\begin{abstract}
  Origins of life are based on supra-molecular structuring
  of nucleic acid polymers in solution, which allows transfer and memory of genetic information in life. 
  Hence, study single mono-nucleotide self-assembly into DNA duplexes is crucial to understand 
  the emergence of life on earth.
  In this work, we numerically investigated the phase behaviour of a solution of DNA
  mono-nucleotides by developing a novel, extremely coarse-grained model. Specifically, 
  we designed a model of a single nucleotide based on a semi-disk-like polyhedron decorated with attractive 
  (patchy) sites for mimicking stacking and pairing interactions. Noteworthy, 
  this model successfully captured the experimental phase behavior which has been recently studied.
  We carried out Monte Carlo simulations of patchy polyhedra by adapting algorithms borrowed 
  from computer graphics.

\section{Introduction}
{\bf\color{red} Tommaso c'è ancora molto da lavorare sul testo, quindi mettici liberamente mano aggiungendo 
magari un pò di citazioni}
Understanding the liquid crystal phase of DNA is of paramount significance for unraveling the enigma of origins of life
on earth. Understanding the self-assembly of DNA mono-nucleotides not only could shed light on the genesis of 
supra-molecular structures crucial for genetic information transfer and memory in life, but also could help the 
development/validation of theories on the emergence of life itself~\cite{Jia}. 
For example it has been argued that  liquid crystal assemblies of nucleic acids may have facilitated the formation 
of long biopolymers necessary for life. In this context, the study of DNA liquid crystals may provide 
insights into the fundamental processes behind life emergence.  \\

Recent research has demonstrated a fascinating phenomenon in the behavior of nucleic acid mononucleotide triphosphates
(dNTPs) when subjected to specific conditions: at sufficiently high concentrations and low temperatures in an aqueous
solution, these molecules undergo a liquid crystalline transition to a columnar phase~\cite{Smith}. 
These dNTPs, with an approximate length of 4 nm, can stack one on top of each other, forming longer strands and thus 
inducing the formation of the columnar phase. These experimental findings calls for 
the development of computational model able to capture and understand the observed phase behavior.
In the literature~\cite{Nguyen,C0JM02355H,Bellini} 
coarse-grained models have been proposed which approximate these filaments as hard cylinders and quasi-cylinders, each with two attractive patches. These models well describe the phase behavior of DNA duplexes (e.g. the Dickerson
dodecamer~\cite{DeMichele12}), exhibiting an isotropic, nematic and columnar phases.
Anyway, DNA mononucleotide do not form a nematic phase at temperatures and concentrations 
similar to those of DNA duplexes.
This inconsistency between experimental findings and simulations results prompts the
pursuit of a suitable numerical description of these experiments. 
The goal of the present work is precisely to develop a coarse-grained mode of dNTPs which fully accounts for the experimental 
results, which exhibit a transition from an isotropic to a columnar phase without any intermediate nematic phase and which is 
possible able to reproduce the temperature dependence of the phase boundaries.

\section{\label{sec:level1}Model and simulation details}
\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{rota.png}
\caption{\label{fig:rota} Patchy semi-disk, that approximates the single nucleotides, with 4 attractive patches, two for stacking and two for pairing. The staking patches are rotated by $\pi/10$ so that the strand rotates on itself. Small blue
 spheres highlight the vertices of the polyhedra.}
\end{figure}
Our approach consists in modeling the dNTPs as semidisk-like polyhedra 
featuring four distinct attractive patches. More specifically, two patches are placed along the cut
edge of the semi-disks to replicate the base-base pairing interaction, while two additional patches are located
at the center of the two bases of the semi-disk to mimic the stacking attraction between two dNTPs. 
To take into account the characteristic twist
of self-assembled DNA strands, the two stacking patches are 
placed in such a way that they give rise to their complete revolution
every 12 bases around the symmetry axis of an self-assembled DNA duplex. 
This is achieved by rotating the two patches belonging to a single semidisk (SD) by $\pi/10$ 
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rota}. 
\\

Each semidisk is modeled as a polyhedra composed of a finite number of vertices, hence they are not exact semidisks (i.e. 
obtained by cutting in half a disk). Therefore, in the following we discuss a procedure to estimate the minimal number 
vertices to use to consider the polyhedra equivalent to exact semidisks. In this respect the goal was to have a polyhedra
which provides a physical behavior identical to that of exact semidisks. In a Monte Carlo simulation of polyhedra is needed
to have an algorithm for detecting their overlap. Since the number of vertices is not necessarily small, 
it was important to employ an efficient algorithm. After having done a comprehensive
evaluation, we found that the algorithm {\it Xenocollide}\cite{libccd} was best option, being both computationally very efficient 
and robust (i.e.~it is ensured that overlap are not missed).\\

We adjusted the model parameters to obtain reasonable values for the persistence and contour length of the self-assemble 
DNA duplexes ({\color{red}Aggiungere qui ref a appendice con studio persistence length?}). These adjustments include a fine-tune of the spatial placement and size of 
the pairing patches, as well as a refinement of the geometry and position of the stacking patches. \\

Since the equilibration process starting from unbounded PSDs is rather slow, 
it will take much time to equilibrate a system large enough to avoid finite size
effects, hence we use the following approach.
Equilibrium liquid crystalline phases (namely, nematic and columnar) are 
initially obtained for patchy cylinders (PHCs). 
In particular we built the whole equation of state of PHCs which exhibits
isotropic ($I$), nematic ($N$), and columnar ($C$) phases as illustrated in Figure 2.
Finally, we replace PHCs with PSDs and we use the resulting configurations
to start new simulations to assess their thermodynamic stability. 
Note that the adoption of four-patch cylinders ensure that by replacing
them with a set of PSDs the bonds between two distinct PSDs are preserved as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fila}.
%%After PHCs are replaced with a set of PSDs, we also checked their stability 
%%through a NTV simulation.
\begin{figure}[h!]

Simulation setup after two (\textbf{b}), four (\textbf{c}) and six (\textbf{d}) million Monte Carlo steps. The half-disks that have both pairing bonds occupied are shown in blue.}
\end{figure}


We note that this approach is justified as long as semidisks selfassemble into cylinder-like aggregates. To verify that this is the case, we performed simulations
of system composed of a small number of PSDs (i.e. small enough to have affordable
computational times) and we checked that they self-assemble into HC-like structures.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:sdselfass}~(a) we show an initial isotropic configurations of PSDs and the resulting final 
(equilibrium) configuration where all PSDs selfassembled into cylinder-like
aggregates. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{sosti4.png}
\caption{\label{fig:fila} The cylinder is replaced by 24 semi-disks. the cylinder patches are rotated to match once the semi-disks are replaced.}
\end{figure}

To verify the stability of the nematic and columnar phases, by substituting the cylinders with cylinder-like aggregates (CLAs) compoded of paired semi-disks as shown
in Fig.\ref{fig:fila}, NVT simulations are performed. 
This replacement has to be done without introducing overlaps between SDs, hence
the SDs must be entirely contained within the original cylinder. Moreover,
the distance between the paired bases of the CLA
is chosen in such a way that the final 
height matches that of the original cylinder. Additionally, the CLA is constructed by introducing a rotation of $\pi/5$, between successive base
pairs, to ensure that the stacking patches are all bonded. 
Figure~\ref{sosti1} shows a nematic phase of HCs with four patches before (a) and after (b)
replacing HCs with PSDs for $P^*=0.55$.

\end{figure} 

\subsection{Approximation of semidisk with convex polyhedra}
By using the algorithm \textit{Xenocollide} the time needed to find if two polyhedra overlap scales 
linearly with the number of vertices.
Hence, determination of an optimal number of vertices for the polyhedra approximation is crucial to have an 
accurate physical description, while maintaining a good computational efficiency.
Here, we discuss how to optimally approximate a semidisk with a convex polyhedron, i.e. 
we seek for using the minimal number of vertices which provides accurate physical properties of the system. 
Our strategy was to build the equation of state (EOS) of hard convex polyhedra which have a cylinder-like 
shape and to compare this EOS with that of real hard cylinders.
We carried out Monte Carlo simulations in the isobaric-isothermal (NPT) ensemble for
cylinders of two different aspect ratio $X_0=L/D$, where $L$ is the length and $D$ the diameter of the cylinder. 
We also simulated cylinder-like polyhedra with the same aspect ratio and composed of 16, 24 and 32 vertices.
Before the production runs, we equilibrated the system for at least $4$ million Monte Carlo steps and we check 
the equilibration by inspecting system volume.
\begin{figure}[h!] \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{cylapprox.png}
  \caption{\label{fig:cylapprox} Equation of state of cylinders with aspect ratio of $L/D=3.68794$. The equation of
  state of the cylinders is compared with the one obtained for cylinder-like polyhedra with 16, 24 and 32 
vertices.}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:cylapprox} shows the resulting EOS obtained for HCs and cylinder-like polyhedra
 with a variable number of vertices. It can be seen that the qualitative physical behavior is preserved for
all number of vertices and that just a slight shift of EOS towards smaller volume fractions can be observed for $V= 16$ and $24$. A satisfactory approximation of the EOS of exact cylinders is achieved with $V=32$ 
vertices. 
%Concerning semi-disks in our numerical simulations we will use $V=18$ vertices, being a semidisk half a cylinder (see Fig.~\ref{fig:cutcyl}). 
Hence, in our numerical simulations of SDs, to achieve the same level of approximation, we will use $V=18$ vertices as shown in Figure \ref{fig:cutcyl}.
\begin{figure}[h!] \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{taglio.png}
  \caption{\label{fig:cutcyl} Top view of an HC and two SDs with a mesh of vertices providing the same
  accuracy in their physica behavior. The HC comprises a total of $V=32$ vertices (16 on the bottom and 16 on the top), while an ``equivalent'' SD is composed of $V=18$ vertices.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{EOS cylinder with 4 patches}
Dickerson dodecamers can be modeled as patchy hard cylinders (PHCs) decorated with two sticky patches on their 
bases~\cite{DeMichele12}. In this case the phase behavior includes isotropic, nematic and columnar phases.
As we anticipated in the introduction, to reduce computational times we first obtain equilibrium configurations
by simulating PHCs and then we replace PHCs with a set of $24$ PSDs. Afterward we make PSDs equilibrate to check the stability
of I, N and Col phases. The only caveat is that we used PHCs decorated with two patches per base, chosen in such a way 
that stacking free energy is identical to that of PHCs with one patch per base, see App. \ref{app:freeenergy}. 
Hence, we built the EOS of PHCs with four patches and then we select I, N e Col configurations to start PSDs simulations
where PSDs replace PHCs.


\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=0.86\linewidth]{eos.png}
\caption{\label{fig:eos1} Equation of state for cylinders with aspect-ratio $X_0=2$ and 2 attractive patches per base. The simulations employ $N = 180$ particles and evolve over 4 million Monte Carlo steps. The triangles in red represent the simulations whose final configurations are used for simulating PSDs after the replacement of HCs.}
\end{figure}

The EOS of PHCs is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:eos1}, where to distinguish the various phase we inspect the radial distribution function we make use of the 
nematic $S$ and hexagonal $\psi_6$ order parameters.
The nematic order parameter $S$ is defined as the largest eigenvalue $S$ of the order tensor $\mathbf{Q}$, i.e.
\begin{equation} 
\label{tensornematic} 
\textit{\textbf{Q}}_{\alpha \beta}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_i^{N} 
\bigg[\frac{3}{2} {(\mathbf{u}_i)}_{\alpha} {(\mathbf{u}_i)}_{\beta} - \frac{1}{2} \delta_{\alpha\beta} \bigg]
\end{equation}
where $N$ the number of particles, $\alpha\beta \in\{x,y,z\}$ and the unit vector
${\mathbf{u}_i}_\alpha$ is the component $\alpha$ of the orientation (i.e. the symmetry axis) of particle $i$.
If $S$ is significantly larger than $0$ particles are aligned along a given axis called the nematic director.

The hexagonal order parameter $\psi_6$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}  
\label{esa}
\langle \psi_6\rangle=\bigg\langle \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{n(i)} \sum_{j=1}^{n(i)}e^{6i\theta_{ij}} \bigg\rangle
\end{equation}
Where $n(i)$ is the number of first neighbors to the molecule $i$ on the same layer, $\theta_{ij}$ is the angle between the two molecules $i$ and $j$ with respect to an axis orthogonal to the nematic axis. Finally, the radial distribution function is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
	g(\textbf{r})=\frac{1}{\rho N} \biggl \langle \sum^N_{i=1} \sum_{j\neq i} \delta ( \mathbf{r} - (\textbf{r}_i-\textbf{r}_j))\biggl \rangle
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the density of the system,  $\mathbf{r}_i$ the position of the $i$-th particle and $ \delta(\mathbf{r})$ is the Dirac delta function.\\ 

To build the EOS shown in Fig.\ref{fig:eos1} 
we use just $N=180$ and it is likely that finite-size effects are not negligible. Nevertheless, we remind
that the isotropic, nematic and columnar configuration will be used as starting configuration for PSD
simulations after HCs will be replaced with SDs.
Since each PHCs is replaced with $24$ semidisks, this makes the total number of PSDs to simulate equal to
$4320$, which is already a large number.
Hence, we decided to use $N=180$ PHCs to keep simulations times small while not comprising too much 
accuracy in the physical behavior of PSDs.

\section{\label{exp}Experimental methods}

{\bf \color{red} Tommaso penso che sia il caso di dare un pò di dettagli qui sugli esperimenti?}

\section{\label{Results}Results}
We now discuss how to choose the stacking and pairing energies in the simulations. Experimentally, the stacking interaction
strength is larger than the pairing interaction strength. 
Hence, in our model we set a pairing energy equal to half of the stacking energy.
%This decision is made because if the phase dissolution occurs even under these conditions,
%it will certainly happen with weaker pairing bonds. 
As initial configuration for simulating PSDs we used those corresponding to the triangles in Fig.~\ref{fig:eos1}.
\begin{figure}[h!]

%Three nematic phases and four columnar phases of cylinders with different volume fractions, and thus concentrations,

The dNTPs and their stability are studied by carrying out a Monte Carlo NVT simulation at various temperatures
$T^*=[0.10:0.15]$ for each starting configuration. We first note that for all temperatures investigated, the initially
nematic phases are never stable and system always become isotropic, whereas the initially columnar phases are stable at
low temperatures.  Figure~\ref{fig:par} shows the nematic and columnar order parameters for two starting
configurations, one nematic and the other one columnar. In this figure we also show the pair  distribution functions of
the columnar case on the plane orthogonal to the nematic axis; note the decrease of hexagonal ordering as the
temperature increases.

\subsection{Comparative Analysis of Experimental and Simulation Results}

Here we compare simulations results with experimental findings on dTTP/dATP mononucleotides~\cite{Smith}.
We expressed system concentration $c$ of computer simulations in mg/ml, where the conversion 
from volume fraction $\phi$ to concentration $c$ in mg/ml can be obtained as follows
\begin{equation}
	c=\frac{N}{V}m_N
	\label{conc}
\end{equation}
where $N$ represents the number of semi-disks within the simulation box's volume $V$, and $m_N$ denotes the molecular
mass of a single nucleotide, measured in Daltons ($Da$). For dTTP and dATP filaments, the molecular masses are
$m_N=482.2\; Da$ and $m_N=491.2\; Da$ respectively. Since the experimental results refer to a mixture of dTTP and dATP
filaments, we consider for the conversion the average molecular masses of the two species, i.e. $m_N=486.7\; Da$. 
Figure~\ref{fig:wide}, shows experimental  findings of dATP/dTTP filaments~\cite{Smith} together with Monte Carlo
simulation results of PSDs.  Above a concentration of 600 mg/ml simulations exhibit a phase transition from I to Col,
whereas at lower concentration system is isotropic for all temperatures investigated. This behavior matches the
experimental results and more interestingly our model seems to have the right temperature dependence concerning the
phase boundaries.

\begin{figure*}[t!] \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{finaleeng.png} \caption{\label{fig:wide}Phase diagram of
    dTTP/dATP DNA strands. The square and round symbols refer to the experimental results while the triangular symbols
  refer to the results obtained from the simulations. The orange area indicates where the columnar phase is present.}
\end{figure*}



The absence of a nematic phase in the phase diagram of PSDs can be rationalized through Wertheim-like
theory developed in Refs. \cite{Bellini}. Indeed, if we consider aggregating bifunctional HCs of 
length $L$ and diameter $D$ the will form a polydisperse set of polymers (e.g.~see~\cite{DeMichele12}).
We start noting that, in our present case, the self-assembled structure formed by PSDs can be regarded 
as a set of $12$ disks formed each by two paires PSDs, where the stacking free energy of two disks is equal to 
that of two PHCs with four attractive patches.

According to the theory, the average number $M$ of HCs belonging to a polymer at a given concentration 
and temperature in the isotropic phase is:
\begin{equation}
M(\phi, T) = \frac{1}{2}\left( 1 + \sqrt{1 + 4 \phi e^{k_I \phi \eta(\phi)+\beta {\Delta F}_b}} \right) 
\end{equation}
where $k_I$ is a geometric factor that does not depend on HC length $L$, 
$\eta(\phi) = \frac{1}{4} \frac{4-3\phi}{{(1-\phi)}^2}$ is the Parsons-Lee factor
and ${\Delta F}_b$ is the stacking free energy.
If we replace each HC with a set of $N_{sd}$ disks of diameter $D$ length $L/N_{sd}$, whereas the stacking energy between two 
disks is still ${\Delta F}_b$, we can expect $M$ to be unchanged. Anyway, the average contour length ${\cal L}$
is now $\frac{L}{N_{sd}*M}$ while in the previous case it was $\frac{L}{M}$.
Hence the average contour length of polymers becomes $N_{sd}$ times shorter. 
This means that at a given temperature I-N transition shifts to much higher concentrations, if we consider HCs with smaller $L$, 
thus making it hindered by the columnar phase.

{\color{red} NOTA: alle conclusioni bisogna ancora lavorarci un pò}
Our study proposes an extremely coarse-grained model for dTTP/dATP nucleotides that is able to reproduce their 
phase behaviour. By employing SD-like polyhedra decorated with four attractive patches to mimic
stacking and pairing interactions, our model exhibit just isotropic and columnar phases with the absence of
a nematic phase as observed in the experiments.  Furthermore, we provide insights into the stability 
of nematic and columnar phases under varying concentrations and temperatures in these systems. Our model
has potential to be exploited in future studies of DNA mononucleotides and different thermodynamic conditions
and buffer solutions...

\section{Stacking Free Energy}\label{app:freeenergy}

Here, we discuss the calculation of the stacking free energy~\cite{DeMichele12}, which is essential for going from two-patch cylinders to four-patch cylinders. 

For speeding up the equilibration process we first carried out a simulation of HCs decorated with 4 patches on thier
bases and the we replace these cylinders with patchy semidisks. An estimate of the stacking free energy to use for
modeling DNA duplexes with hard cylinders  decorated with two attractive on their bases is known as discussed in
Ref.~\cite{DeMichele12}. The stacking free energy required for the aggregation of two HCs decorated with 4 patches
should be of the same order of the one for the aggregation of two HCs decorated with two patches. Hence, here we
estimate the interaction strength of the two patches on each base of each HC in such way that the stacking free energy
matches with the one of HCs decorated with two patches.


Stacking free energy is defined as:
\begin{equation}
	\beta\Delta F_b=\ln \bigg[2\frac{\Delta(T)}{v_d}\bigg]
	\label{deltaf}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{equation}
\label{deltat}
	\Delta(T)=\frac{1}{4}\bigg\langle \int_{V_b} [e^{-\beta V(\textbf{r}_{12}, \Omega_1, \Omega_2)}-1]d\textbf{r}_{12}\bigg\rangle
\end{equation}

With $\textbf{r}$ denoting the vector connecting the centers of mass of particle 1 and particle 2, $\Omega_i$
representing the orientation of the i-th particle, and $\langle\ldots\rangle$ indicating the average taken over all
directions, $v_d$ stands for the volume of the considered object, while $V_b$ represents the bonding volume. The
calculation of $\Delta (T)$, in the case of attractive patches, simplifies and for two patches per base one has: 
\begin{equation}
\label{deltat2}
	\Delta(T)=\frac{1}{4N}\big( N_1(e^{\beta u_0}-1)+N_2(e^{2\beta u_0}-1)\big)
\end{equation}

where $u_0$ is the bonding energy, $N$ indicates the total number of insertions, $N_1$ and $N_2$ represent the occurrences of having one and two
bonds, respectively. 

Through a Monte Carlo algorithm, one can estimate $\Delta(T)$ and find $T^*_{2 patch}=k_B T_{2 patch}/U_0$, such that ${\Delta F_b}^{1 patch}(T^*_{1 patch})=\Delta F_b^{2 patch}(T^*_{2 patch})$, 
which is then use ad a first estimate of stacking energy to use in the simulations.
